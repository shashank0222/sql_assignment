    "A database is an organized collection of data that can be accessed electronically. It is a collection of data that is stored and organized in such a way that it can be easily accessed, managed and updated.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL (Structured Query Language) databases are primarily called Relational Databases (RDBMS); whereas NoSQL databases are primarily called non-relational or distributed databases1. SQL databases define and manipulate data-based structured query language (SQL). SQL is one of the most versatile and widely-used options available which makes it a safe choice, especially for great complex queries. But from another side, it can be restrictive. SQL requires you to use predefined schemas to determine the structure of your data before you work with it. Also, all of your data must follow the same structure. This can require significant up-front preparation which means that a change in the structure would be both difficult and disruptive to your whole system1.\n",
    "\n",
    "A NoSQL database has a dynamic schema for unstructured data. Data is stored in many ways which means it can be document-oriented, column-oriented, graph-based, or organized as a key-value store. This flexibility means that documents can be created without having a defined structure first. Also, each document can have its own unique structure1.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main differences between NoSQL and SQL databases are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Type: SQL databases are primarily called Relational Databases (RDBMS); whereas NoSQL databases are primarily called non-relational or distributed databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Language: SQL databases define and manipulate data-based structured query language (SQL). A NoSQL database has a dynamic schema for unstructured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalability: In almost all situations SQL databases are vertically scalable. This means that you can increase the load on a single server by increasing things like RAM, CPU, or SSD. But on the other hand, NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable. This means that you handle more traffic by sharding, or adding more servers in your NoSQL database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Structure: SQL databases are table-based on the other hand NoSQL databases are either key-value pairs, document-based, graph databases, or wide-column stores.\n",
    "\n",
    "Property followed: SQL databases follow ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability) whereas the NoSQL database follows the Brewers CAP theorem (Consistency, Availability, and Partition tolerance).\n",
    "\n",
    "Support: Great support is available for all SQL databases from their vendors. Also, a lot of independent consultants are there who can help you with SQL databases for very large-scale deployments but for some NoSQL databases you still have to rely on community support and only limited outside experts are available for setting up and deploying your large-scale NoSQL deploy.\n"
